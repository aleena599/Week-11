This line stuck with me because I didn’t fully realize how much of research is invisible unless someone actively chooses to make it visible. Reading Marwick and doing the Week 11 R work made me see how much actually gets lost when people don’t document their steps. It’s not just about writing things down — it’s about leaving behind a trail that someone else can actually follow. I used to think this was mainly an archaeology problem, because their work has so many layers of data, tools, and field notes. But this week made me think about what that means for History too.

As a History student, I’m honestly used to thinking that our “data” is already there — archives, documents, letters, whatever. But working through the coding exercises, dealing with broken links, and seeing how archaeologists use documentation to make their work reusable made me realize historians actually hide a lot of their process. The interpretations we read in books or articles look clean, as if the author magically arrived at their conclusion. Meanwhile, I spent half this week fighting with R because I forgot to set my working directory or because my dataset name didn’t match. Those mistakes are still part of the process. They show how I got to the final result.

If historians made their work reproducible, it would mean showing the path, not just the destination. Like: which sources they chose, which ones they ignored, how they organized material, what decisions they made that shaped the final argument. All of that usually disappears. History would change a lot if we expected scholars to show their process the same way we expect archaeologists to show theirs. It would make the discipline more transparent but also less mysterious. People would see that history isn’t just storytelling — it’s a series of choices, interpretations, and even errors.

The idea of reproducibility also pushes historians to be more systematic. Not necessarily using code (though some could), but at least documenting decisions in a way that others could retrace or question. I think that could make history education more hands-on. Instead of just reading finished texts, students would work with actual workflows — drafts, notes, messy data organization, conflicting sources. It might even make history feel less intimidating because students could see that experts struggle too, and that uncertainty is part of the job.

And for public-facing work, transparency matters even more. If the public can see how history was made — not just what the final version says — it can build trust. With misinformation everywhere, being able to show your steps could make historical interpretation feel more credible and collaborative. It also lets communities participate more. Archaeology already uses open data to let people remix or reinterpret findings, and I can imagine historians doing something similar with archival material, local histories, or community documents.

So overall, this week made me realize that reproducibility isn’t just a technical thing. It’s a shift in mindset. It’s about being less protective of your process and more open about the work that goes on behind the scenes. As a history student, it made me see that what I produce isn’t just the polished essay — it’s also all the choices and detours that led me there. And documenting those things doesn’t just help others; it also helps my future self understand what I did and why.
