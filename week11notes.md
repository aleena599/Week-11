Marwick keeps stressing “documentation” — honestly didn’t realize how big of a deal it is in archaeology. Thought it was just writing notes, but apparently it’s way deeper (code, workflows, decisions, everything).

He talks about “reproducibility.” I always hear this word but never fully got it until now — basically someone should be able to redo your work without guessing. Makes sense.

Interesting point: you don’t need perfect documentation, just enough that someone can follow your thinking. Kinda relieving lol.

I didn’t know archaeologists use so many digital tools?? I thought it was all field stuff, but nope — coding, R, datasets, etc.

Came across this idea that documentation is like leaving a trail behind you. If you don’t, your future self won’t even know what you did (I felt that).

Week 11 coding stuff connected a lot — like using R Markdown. I didn’t realize that writing code and comments IS a form of documentation.

The “everything you do should be trackable” idea — kinda intimidating but I get why it matters.

Errors I kept running into during the R part:

forgetting to set the working directory (again)

dataset wouldn’t load because I misspelled the file name

had to rerun stuff multiple times because I realized I didn’t comment anything
→ made me see why Marwick says clean workflow = easier life

Something new I came across: the idea of “reproducible archaeology” being part of ethical research. That was new to me — didn’t realize ethics connected to transparency like that.

Also didn’t know documentation could include your failed attempts or decisions you didn’t use. Apparently that’s valuable too.

The reading + the R script made me realize: documentation is honestly more about good habits than technical skill. Just writing down what you did as you go.

Overall takeaway I jotted down for myself:
